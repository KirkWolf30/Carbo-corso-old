Our Story
The traditional name of Cape Coast, ‘Oguaa’, which is still in use, is derived from the Fante word ‘gua’ (market).  During the time of Portuguese colonization, Oguaa was named Cabo Corso (Short Cape).  Later, the name was changed by the British to Cape Coast.  We are from Cape Coast and naming this restaurant Cabo Corso recognizes the distinct story, culture, history and heritage of a powerfully resilient people

We source from local farmers, not factories 
At Cabo Corso, our commitment to local farmers is strong, we believe that the best route out of poverty for the majority of Africa’s rural poor is the development of profitable agriculture with strong links to market which aid in the reduction of poverty and improvement of food security.
